```
db.courses.aggregate([
  { $sort: { credits: -1 } }, 
  { $limit: 1 }             
]);
```
### Task 16: Use the $and operator for filtering students
```
db.students.find({
  $and: [
    { department: "CSE" },
    { $expr: { $gt: [{ $size: "$courses" }, 2] } }
  ]
});
```
### Task 17: Add a new field to all documents in the students collection

```
db.students.updateMany(
  {}, 
  { $set: { activeStatus: true } }

### Task 18: Use $rename to rename a field

```
db.students.updateMany(
  {}, 
  { $rename: { "coursesEnrolled": "enrolledCourses" } } 
);
```
### Task 19: Set default values for new fields in all student documents
```
db.students.updateMany(
  {}, 
  { $set: { graduationYear: 2025 } } 
);
```
### Task 20: Use the $push operator to add a new course to a studentâ€™s course list
```
db.students.updateOne(
  { name: "Mahir" },
